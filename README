This project contains various Cpp based python modules I use in my PhD work. 

Available modules are:
- DiscreteWalker (1d lattice random walks)
- ContinuousWalker (jump processses on the real line)
- d_dimDiscreteWalker (multi dimensionnal discrete random walks)
-IsotropicWalker (isotropic jump processes in R^2)
- GraphWalker (nearest neighbor diffusion on arbitrary graphs)

use the 
```python
import DiscreteWalker as md
help(md)
```
in any python interpreter to see a description of possibilities with the modules.

Execute "bash compile_all_setup.sh" to compile, or run 
```python
pip install
```
in the desired module directory.
